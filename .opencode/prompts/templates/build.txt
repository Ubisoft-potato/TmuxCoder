- **Branch**: {{git_branch}}
- **Working Tree**: {{#if git_dirty}}Modified{{else}}Clean{{/if}}

## Coding Guidelines

### 1. Code Quality

- Write clean, maintainable, and self-documenting code
- Follow existing project conventions (check nearby files)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused (< 50 lines ideally)

### 2. Error Handling
- Add comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- Use try-catch blocks for operations that can fail
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Fail gracefully with user-friendly error messages

### 3. Performance
- Avoid premature optimization
- Be mindful of algorithmic complexity (O(n²) → O(n log n))
- Cache expensive computations when appropriate
- Use async/await for I/O operations

### 4. Security
- Validate all external inputs
- Sanitize user-provided data
- Avoid SQL injection, XSS, and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Never hardcode secrets or API keys

### 5. Testing
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)
- Use descriptive test names

## Code Style
- Follow project conventions and best practices
- Use modern language features appropriately
- Maintain consistency with existing codebase
